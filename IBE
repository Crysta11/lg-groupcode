##Code adapted from LDG-2016 course week 7 supplementary materials

#----------------------------File Management--------------------------#

##Directory where all the genetics are.  File management is as follows:
#First folder within the genetics folder contains IBE distance matrices, folder named "1_Cost"
#There are duplicate cost files equal to the number of MC runs being analyzed
#Rest of the folders are folders of Genetic output for each MC run
#Within each MC run folders, there are folders for "Extant" and genetic distances.
#The Extant files should be relabeled to "1_Extant" so it won't interfere with the for-loop later
#Output files will be written to MC run folders.

#-------------------------Directory Map-------------------------------#
#	Genetics
#		1_Cost
#		con2hab2_[MC run]
