######CDPOP - this is currently part of circuitscape code (to call into R); CDPOP source files available at https://github.com/ComputationalEcologyLab/CDPOP
rm(list=ls())  #[I don't know what this is...do we need it? - cg]  Nathan: This removes any previous lists from R-I don't think we need it

# load libraries [do we need to load any libraries? - cg] Nathan: ##No library is needed! This is all built into R :D
library(?)

# Make a place holder for the cs_run.exe [is CDPOP a .exe? - cg]  Nathan: I think it would be... 
CS_exe <- 'C:\\"Program Files"\\Circuitscape\\cs_run.exe' # Don't forget the "Program Files" problem [will we have a program files problem? - cg]

setwd("") [Whatever we want to set directory to]


#Paige: CDPOP into R: This is the code I have so far. It is not working: I recieve error message 127 (basically, program won't run). 
#Any ideas? The inpputvars.csv is the only input needed for the program. 
#I have tried two different approaches to running CDPOP:

#1: based off of Nathan's code for running Circuitscape: 
setwd("C:\\Users\\pab85_000\\Desktop\\CDPOP-master) #the folder contatining the input files and source folder
CDPOP_exe="C:\\Users\\pab85_000\\Desktop\\CDPOP-master\\src" #the folder containing the CDPOP source files
CDPOP_run=paste(CDPOP_exe, paste(getwd(), "C:\\Users\\pab85_000\\Desktop\\CDPOP-master\\Data\\inputvars_test.csv", sep="/"))
system(CDPOP_run)

2: based on code I found online for calling python in R:
system("python C:\\Users\\pab85_000\\Desktop\\CDPOP-master\\src\\CDPOP.py inputvars_test.csv output_test")
#Recieved this error message: 
User must specify data directory, input file name, and output file directory (e.g., at command line type CDPOP.py ../CDPOP_data/ inputvariables16pnts.csv exampleout).
Warning message:
running command 'python C:\Users\pab85_000\Desktop\CDPOP-master\src\CDPOP.py inputvars_test.csv output_test' had status 65535
